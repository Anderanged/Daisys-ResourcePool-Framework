implement an energy system and the relevant functions required to allow modders the ability to utilize it for practically ANY purpose.

# Energy System
- able to be initialized on any object
- can be frozen to prevent alteration of resource {DSY_rpf_freeze var and EH}
- can define a loop func to renew or decay the pool over time
- init options:
    - object to init on <OBJ>
        - object
    - custom pool name <STR>
        - "name"
    - limits of pool <ARRAY>
        - [lower, upper]
    - renew/decay/neither deliniator <NUM>
        - static = 0
        - renew  = 1
        - decay  = 2

## Operations
- addition
- subtraction
- [OPTIONAL] multiplication
- [OPTIONAL] division
    - mult and div are both in practice not useful. addition and subtraction are used most frequently.
    - Niche cases for mult and div are at most just interesting, but not practical.
    - Thus, operation deliniator var can be <BOOL>

## Functions
- initPool
    - initializes vars on pool from args
        - args

            - renew/decay/neither deliniator <NUM>
